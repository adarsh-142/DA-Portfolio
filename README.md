# Adarsh Anil Kumar - Data Analyst Portfolio

## About
My name is Adarsh Anil Kumar. I am a postgraduate student bound to completing an MSc. degree in Data Science and Analytics. I have developed a great interest in solving questions through the cultivation of an analytical mind. Such a mindset has awakened my passion for answering questions and uncovering relevant insights.<br><br>
Through my introduction to the concept of Data Analytics through the Google Data Analytics Certificate program provided by Coursera, it had given me the necessary push to pursue higher studies pertaining to the same concept. During my higher studies, I was exposed to the deeper technical aspects behind Data Analytics, introducing me to various methodologies and technologies that are relevant for the current industry standards.<br><br>
I was able to dabble in and develop my technical skills in Python, SQL, Excel and Power BI alongside various tools and software including the likes of Visual Studio Code, Jupyter Notebooks, Microsoft SQL Server and Google Colab. Such accomplishments was made possible through various university assignments and personal projects. Such projects raised my skills in statistical data analysis, data transformations, probability distributions and data visualization.<br><br>
I take delight in taking on new projects to reinforce the skills that I have learned while learning new skills at the same time. While, most of the projects I have undertaken, had been independent, I am rather excited to work as a part of a team to understand the perspective of other gifted people and learn from the experienced while imparting my knowledge when applicable.<br><br> 
This is a space I have created to showcase my talent and knowledge through personal work while picking up on mistakes made prior to help publish more higher quality projects in the future.<br><br>

## Personal Projects
- **Segment-based Factor Analysis with ML Regression & XAI Implementation**<br><br>
  - Data: 2010 New York Hospital Inpatient Discharge Data [[Source](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thedevastator/2010-new-york-state-hospital-inpatient-discharge)]<br><br>
  - Dimensions: 38 Columns | 2.62 Million Rows<br><br>
  - Goal: To analyze the difference between significant factors affecting a patient's Length of Stay (LoS) in hospitals between Elective and Emergency Admission records.<br><br>
  - Purpose: To emphasize clinical decision making, which in turn can help address on how to better handle and optimize LoS for patients coming under both admission types.<br><br>
  - Skills Portrayed: Python Programming, Data Cleaning, Data Visualization, Correlation, Feature Engineering, Machine Learning, Cross-Validation, Explainable AI, Insight Reflection<br><br>
  - Technology: Python<br><br>
    - Libraries: Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-Learn, SciPy, Category Encoders, Statsmodels, XGBoost, Tensorflow, Numpy, SHAP<br><br>
  - Software Used: Google Colab<br><br>
  - Result: **Found inconsistencies between feature importance rankings of both admission types with Hospital Operational Charges and Patient Bills being the top 2 consistently significant factors affecting LoS for both types while Surgeries for patients under Elective Admission is more significant compared to those under Emergency Admission circumstances.**<br><br>
  - Files and Details:<br><br>

- **ETL Process Simulation with Dashboard Visualization**<br><br>
  - Data: Coffee Beans Sales Raw Data [[Source](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/saadharoon27/coffee-bean-sales-raw-dataset)]<br><br>
  - Dimensions: Customers (9 Columns | 1000 Rows); Orders (5 Columns | 1000 Rows); Products (7 Columns | 48 Rows)<br><br>
  - Goal: To identify the most profitable coffee type and related sales inferences from all coffee products sold over a 43-month time period across UK, USA and Ireland through the use of a dashboard visualization.<br><br>
  - Purpose: To provide a base of insights over which the company could act upon to optimize sales and profit for their coffee products.<br><br>
  - Skills Portrayed: Data Extraction, SQL Queries, SQL Table Joins, SQL Common Table Expressions, Power Query Data Transformation, BI Data Visualization, DAX Queries<br><br>
  - Technology: SQL, Excel and Power BI<br><br>
  - Software Used: Microsoft SQL Server, Microsoft Excel, Microsoft Power BI<br><br>
  - Result: **Found Arabica to be the most profitable coffee type among all coffee products with a profit margin of 72%**<br><br>
  - Files and Details:<br><br>

- **Experimental Design and Analysis for Performance Evaluation**<br><br>
  - Data: Self-Generated A/B Testing Dataset [[Source](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/adarsh0806/ab-testing-practice)]<br><br>
  - Dimensions: 7 Columns | 5000 Rows<br><br>
  - Goal: To obtain the lift between control group and treatment group <br><br>
  - Purpose: Developed as a project to practice and comprehend A/B testing.<br><br>
  - Skills Portrayed: Python Programming, Random Sampling, Hypothesis Testing, Statistics, Data <br><br>
  - Technology: Python<br><br>
    - Libraries: Pandas, Numpy, Scipy<br><br>
  - Software Used: Visual Studio Code<br><br>
  - Result: **Found a significant difference between conversion rates of both groups while achieving a lift of 160.548%, highlighting the significant improvement made through the treatment group while compared to the control group.**<br><br>
  - Files and Details:<br><br>
