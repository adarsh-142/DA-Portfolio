# Adarsh Anil Kumar - Data Analyst

## About
My name is Adarsh Anil Kumar. I am a postgraduate student bound to completing an MSc. degree in Data Science and Analytics. I have developed a great interest in solving questions through the cultivation of an analytical mind. Such a mindset has awakened my passion for answering questions and uncovering relevant insights.<br>
Through my introduction to the concept of Data Analytics through the Google Data Analytics Certificate program provided by Coursera, it had given me the necessary push to pursue higher studies pertaining to the same concept. During my higher studies, I was exposed to the deeper technical aspects behind Data Analytics, introducing me to various methodologies and technologies that are relevant for the current industry standards.
