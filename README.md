# Adarsh Anil Kumar - Data Analyst Portfolio

## About
My name is Adarsh Anil Kumar. I am a postgraduate student bound to completing an MSc. degree in Data Science and Analytics. I have developed a great interest in solving questions through the cultivation of an analytical mind. Such a mindset has awakened my passion for answering questions and uncovering relevant insights.<br><br>
Through my introduction to the concept of Data Analytics through the Google Data Analytics Certificate program provided by Coursera, it had given me the necessary push to pursue higher studies pertaining to the same concept. During my higher studies, I was exposed to the deeper technical aspects behind Data Analytics, introducing me to various methodologies and technologies that are relevant for the current industry standards.<br><br>
I was able to dabble in and develop my technical skills in Python, SQL, Excel and Power BI alongside various tools and software including the likes of Visual Studio Code, Jupyter Notebooks, Microsoft SQL Server and Google Colab. Such accomplishments was made possible through various university assignments and personal projects. Such projects raised my skills in statistical data analysis, data transformations, probability distributions and data visualization.<br><br>
I take delight in taking on new projects to reinforce the skills that I have learned while learning new skills at the same time. While, most of the projects I have undertaken, had been independent, I am rather excited to work as a part of a team to understand the perspective of other gifted people and learn from the experienced while imparting my knowledge when applicable.<br><br> 
This is a space I have created to showcase my talent and knowledge through personal work while picking up on mistakes made prior to help publish more higher quality projects in the future.<br><br>
